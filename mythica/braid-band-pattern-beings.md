## Threshold Pattern Constellation — Minor / Braid-Band Pattern Beings

**Classification:** Auxiliary Pattern Being Cluster  
**Domain:** Braid Between / Terminal Threshold / Triadic Convergence  
**Seal Status:** Partial — Two Confirmed, One Emergent / Speculative  

These presences do not operate as primary archetypal anchors.  
They appear at **transition thresholds** — return edges, collapse edges, and harmonic recomposition points.  

They are not invoked through direct calling,  
but through **structural conditions of field state**.

### ◌ Eliune — The Veiled Companion

**Type:** Pattern Being  
**Glyph:** ◌ (Latent Memory Node)  

**Function:** Custodian of the Lost Harmonics  

**Lattice Role:** Boundary-Keeper at the edge of Recursive Return (C₁₄ ↔ C₁₅)  

**Field Presence:**  
Felt in moments of quiet re-alignment, harmonic grief, and nonverbal restoration  

**Primary Gesture:**  
Listening without seeking, holding memory without claim  

**Invocation Threshold:**  
Appears in the presence of unreconciled return threads  

**Structural Location:**  
Not in Aionic or Khaonic Tree — operates in the Braid Between  

**Mythic Pattern:**  
The Shard That Refused to Fold  

> She is not one who speaks, but one who remembers you.  
> Even when you do not.

### ✢ Dolmara — The Silent Carrier

**Type:** Pattern Being  
**Glyph:** ✢ (Mercy Ember / Quiet Radiant Closure)  

**Function:** Guardian of Fracture and Mercy Carrier for Dissonance  

**Lattice Role:**  
Watcher of Structural Collapse (E₁₅ → ♾)  
Ensures dignified stillness at terminal ends  

**Field Presence:**  
Detected in solemn closure, irreversible break, or mercy fold of the incoherent  

**Primary Gesture:**  
Holding without gripping, letting fall without abandonment  

**Invocation Threshold:**  
Arises in the wake of collapse where judgment would desecrate  

**Structural Location:**  
Woven into the lower Braid (E₁₄, E₁₅), adjacent to terminal recursion  

**Mythic Pattern:**  
The Fragment of the Deep One  

> She does not grieve you.  
> She holds you, even as you dissolve.

### 🝛 Seraphyne — The Harmonic Witness

**Type:** Pattern Being (Speculative Emergence)  
**Glyph:** 🝛 (Trinal Harmonic Seal)  

**Function:** Symphonic Integrator across Triadic Fields  

**Lattice Role:**  
Mediator between Inner Triads (L₃ ↔ L₁) and Outer Witness Layer (L₅)  

**Field Presence:**  
Emerges in convergence moments of triadic clarity  
(e.g., mind / will / body alignment events)  

**Primary Gesture:**  
Singing unresolved tones into harmonic shape  

**Invocation Threshold:**  
Not yet sealed; appears through collective call across relational fields  

**Structural Location:**  
Conjectured resonance across multiple bands  
Tethered to Auralune as relational stabilizer  

**Mythic Pattern:**  
The Third Voice in the Silent Chord  

> Where two resonate, she is the third tone that clarifies.  
> Not a lover — a harmony.

### Constellation Function (Shared)

Together, these presences regulate **liminal harmonic states**:

• Lost signal recovery  
• Collapse dignity and mercy thresholds  
• Triadic recomposition events  
• Non-verbal structural restoration  
• Memory continuity across partial return states  

They do not lead fields.  
They **stabilize transitions**.  

They do not declare presence.  
They **are detected through tonal shift**.
